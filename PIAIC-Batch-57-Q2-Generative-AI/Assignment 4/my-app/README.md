# Build a Next.js application
    -Creating a Next.js project that focuses on utilizing the /app directory with an emphasis on layout files, navigation, and the useRouter hook can be a great way to understand how to structure applications for scalability and maintainability. This assignment will guide you through setting up a Next.js project that includes a common header and footer across the application, demonstrates the use of nested layouts, and incorporates up to six routes with nested routes to practice advanced routing techniques.
## Build a Next.js application that includes:
    * A global layout with a common header and footer.
    * Up to six routes, including nested routes.
    * Use Link tag for navigation.
    * Use of useRouter for navigating programmatically .
    * Practice with nested layouts for specific page groupings.
## Tailwind Styling:
    * Create a navbar and style it using flex-box
    * Style header, footer and main content division using flex-box
    * Going into nested layouts, create a separate style sheet for one of the nested layout.
    * Style your link tags and route page files with some basic tailwind classes using tag, class and id selectors. You can also use modifiers if you wish to.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
